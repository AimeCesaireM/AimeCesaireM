## ðŸš€ Projects
Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

### [portfolio-website](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/portfolio-website)
This is my official Github Pages Repository

### [ecc-cryptography](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/ecc-cryptography)
This repository contains the implementation of elliptic curve cryptography algorithms in Python, including several cryptographic functions and methods for working with elliptic curves over finite fields.

### [CRC](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/CRC)
A Java-based implementation of a data link layer protocol that utilizes CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for error detection. This project handles framing using start/stop tags, byte packing, and provides robust frame processing.

### [Steganography-Detector](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/Steganography-Detector)
The `Phase1` program decodes hidden messages (text or images) embedded within a source image using steganographic techniques. It supports decoding text and images by extracting least significant bits (LSBs) from the source image.

### [Pacman AI Agents](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/AI-Projects)
This collection of Pacman agents utilize various artificial intelligence algorithms to mazimize the score in various scenarios of the Pacman game.
