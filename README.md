# Hi, I'm Aime Cesaire

I learn by building small AI agents, security tooling, and pragmatic full-stack apps. None of these projects are perfect, but each one taught me something concrete about reliability, safety, or user-facing polish.

## What I'm focused on
- Writing classical AI agents (search, minimax, RL) and measuring how small changes affect behavior.
- Prototyping cryptography and steganography utilities to understand where attacks actually work.
- Keeping a handle on deployment basics (React/Next, Node, Hardhat, Docker, Firebase) so ideas are easy to share.
- Studying systems topics—networking, operating systems, optimization—to ground the above in reality.

## Stack I reach for
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, Java, C++, Solidity, Dart.
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind, Flutter.
- **AI / Data**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn.
- **Systems & Infra**: Hardhat, Docker, GitHub Actions, WSL, Firebase, MongoDB, MySQL.

## Recent Projects
### AI and automation
- [Pacman AI Agents](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/AI-Projects) — Implements BFS/DFS search, heuristic planners, minimax/expectimax adversarial agents, and a small reinforcement-learning setup for the UC Berkeley Pacman framework. Includes comparison scripts to show win rates and scores per map.

### Security, cryptography, and steganography
- [Phase 1 — Steganography Detector](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/Steganography-Detector) — CLI utility that reads PNG/BMP carriers, extracts least-significant-bit payloads, and reconstructs hidden text or images. Useful for coursework demos and basic forensic drills.
- [ouispar — Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/ecc-cryptography) — Straightforward Python implementation of finite-field arithmetic, point addition/multiplication, and key exchange helpers. I use it to step through ECC math instead of treating it as a black box.
- [Error Detection on Network Data Link Layers](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/CRC) — Java simulator for CRC-based framing. It handles start/stop flags, byte stuffing, and bit-flip injection so I can visualize how resilient a frame format is before writing firmware-level code.

### Full stack and systems delivery
- [Mammoth Rumble — Decentralized Voting](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/Decentralized-Voting) — Solidity contracts plus a React dashboard that run on Hardhat, ethers.js, and IPFS. The live demo at [34.16.36.118](http://34.16.36.118) is basic, but it proves the ballot flow end-to-end on test networks.
- [portfolio-website](https://aimecesairem.github.io/portfolio-website/) — Personal site built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. It doubles as a lab for layout experiments and accessibility tweaks.

## Fun fact
I'm named after Aimé Césaire, the poet, author, and statesman from Martinique. If you have reading recs from his era, I’m all ears. Thanks for visiting.
