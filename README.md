# Hi, I'm Aime Cesaire

I build AI-heavy systems that have to be secure, observable, and production-ready. My work spans autonomous agents, high-assurance systems, and end-to-end products that tie research-grade ideas to shipped experiences.

## Focus Areas
- AI and automation: planning-first agents, search heuristics, and practical ML tooling.
- Secure systems: cryptography, steganalysis, zero-knowledge-inspired primitives, and verifiable pipelines.
- Systems and networking: reliability tooling across data link, distributed, and resource-constrained environments.
- Full stack delivery: React/Next, Node, Solidity, and fast iteration on design-to-deploy workflows.

## Core Stack
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, Java, C++, Solidity, Dart.
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind, Flutter.
- **AI / Data**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn.
- **Systems & Infra**: Hardhat, Docker, GitHub Actions, WSL, Firebase, MongoDB, MySQL.

## Featured Repositories
### AI and Intelligent Systems
- [Pacman AI Agents](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/AI-Projects) — A portfolio of search, adversarial, and reinforcement-learning agents that optimize Pacman scenarios. Includes benchmarking harnesses to compare heuristics and pluggable evaluators for rapid experimentation.

### Security, Cryptography, and Steganography
- [Phase 1 — Steganography Detector](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/Steganography-Detector) — Image steganalysis toolkit that extracts LSB payloads for both text and raster content, with deterministic decoding pipelines for forensics.
- [ouispar — Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/ecc-cryptography) — Python implementations of ECC primitives, point addition/multiplication, and finite-field utilities geared toward protocol prototyping.
- [Error Detection on Network Data Link Layers](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/CRC) — Java-based CRC framing engine that simulates byte stuffing, start/stop tagging, and channel noise to validate link-layer resilience.

### Systems and Full Stack Builds
- [Mammoth Rumble — Decentralized Voting](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/Decentralized-Voting) — A Solidity + React stack for verifiable elections that combines Hardhat, ethers.js, IPFS, and a hosted frontend to prove ballot integrity. Live demo at [34.16.36.118](http://34.16.36.118).
- [portfolio-website](https://aimecesairem.github.io/portfolio-website/) — Minimal, high-performance personal site deployed on GitHub Pages with a design system shared across recruiting deliverables.
