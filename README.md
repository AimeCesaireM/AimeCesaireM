## ðŸš€ Projects
Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:
- ### [portfolio-website](https://aimecesairem.github.io/portfolio-website/)
  This is my official Portfolio Website on GitHub Pages

- ### [Mammoth Rumble -Decentralized Voting](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/Decentralized-Voting)
  A Solidity-based Web3 solution to election integrity and anonymity. This project utilizes Hardhat, the ethers API, the IPFS protocol, and React to interact with a Solidity smart contract to deliver a web app to conduct transparent elections. Visit the web app [here](http://34.16.36.118)

- ### [ouispar- An elliptical curve cryptography application](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/ecc-cryptography)
  This repository contains the implementation of elliptic curve cryptography algorithms in Python, including several cryptographic functions and methods for working with elliptic curves over finite fields.

- ### [Error detection on network data link layers](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/CRC)
  A Java-based implementation of a data link layer protocol that utilizes CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for error detection. This project handles framing using start/stop tags and byte packing and provides robust frame processing.

- ### [Phase 1 - A Steganography-Detector](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/Steganography-Detector)
  The `Phase1` program decodes hidden messages (text or images) embedded within a source image using steganographic techniques. It supports decoding text and images by extracting the least significant bits (LSBs) from the source image.

- ### [Pacman AI Agents](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/AI-Projects)
  This collection of Pacman agents utilizes various artificial intelligence algorithms to maximize the score in various scenarios of the Pacman game.
