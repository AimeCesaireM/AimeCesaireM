## ðŸš€ Projects
Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

### [portfolio-website](https://aimecesairem.github.io/portfolio-website/)
This is my official Portfolio Website on Github Pages

### [Mammoth Rumble -Decentralized Voting](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/Decentralized-Voting)
A Solidity based Web3 solution to election integrity and anonymity. This project utilizes Hardhat, the ethers API, the IPFS protocol, and React to interact with a Solidity smart contract to deliver a web app to conduct transparent elections. Visit the web app [here](http://34.16.36.118)

### [ouispar- An elliptical curve cryptography applcation](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/ecc-cryptography)
This repository contains the implementation of elliptic curve cryptography algorithms in Python, including several cryptographic functions and methods for working with elliptic curves over finite fields.

### [Error detection on network data link layers](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/CRC)
A Java-based implementation of a data link layer protocol that utilizes CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for error detection. This project handles framing using start/stop tags, byte packing, and provides robust frame processing.

### [Phase 1 - A Steganography-Detector](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/Steganography-Detector)
The `Phase1` program decodes hidden messages (text or images) embedded within a source image using steganographic techniques. It supports decoding text and images by extracting least significant bits (LSBs) from the source image.

### [Pacman AI Agents](https://github.com/AimeCesaireM/AI-Projects)
This collection of Pacman agents utilize various artificial intelligence algorithms to mazimize the score in various scenarios of the Pacman game.
